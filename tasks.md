# To Do

    1)  improve gym filter - price range filter (this might not be doable since we wont know up to date this figure) - by location too
    2)  when searching a location have suggestions pop up while you search
    3)  make social medias
    4)  Make the "log in to leave a review" better
    5)  add gyms to the database (done!)
    6)  figure out why the hell the gym map is not visible for mobile on desctop bit is visible on my actual phone 
    7)  add the form auth codes to .env (I think we should do this) (what does this even mean)
    8)  the log in token keep expiring and it kills the database
    9)  all the gyms that come  from the txt file cant have reviews on them since they are not in the DB (Done!)
