To Do:
    2) improve gym filter
        - I want rating filter
        - price tange filter (this might not be doable since we wont know up to date this figure)
        - by location too

    3) when searching a location have suggestions pop up while you search
    9) make social medias  
    10) More feedback so when you are not logged in it says you cant leave a review.
                Maybe like "log in to leave a review"
    11) add gyms to the database
    12) figure out why the hell the gym map is not visible for mobile on desctop bit is visible
            on my actual phone
    13) add the form auth codes to .env (I think we     should do this)
