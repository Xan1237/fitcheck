To Do:
    2) improve gym filter
        - I want rating filter
        - filter by gym tags
        - price tange filter (this might not be doable since we wont know up to date this figure)
        - 

    3) when searching a location have suggestions pop up while you search
    6) change the gym hours so they are correct for each gym
    7) add dont see your gym form
    8) add contact us page
    9) make social medias  
    10) More feedback so when you are not logged in it says you cant leave a review.
                Maybe like "log in to leave a review"
    11) on review page we need to add commoun gym tags. So once a lot of reviews say 
                a gym has something that gym will get taged with this being a feature
                of the gym. this can then be used to filter the gym
