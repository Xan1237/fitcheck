# To Do

    2)  when searching a location have suggestions pop up while you search
    3)  Make the "log in to leave a review" better
    6)  the log in token keep expiring and it kills the database
    7) split controllers into multiple files for better code clairity
    8) Create a system for recomending diffrent post/ pageanation for the results
    9) post likes
    12) for create profile, Gender should be a checkable box not a typing input box
    13) edit profile doest work cause username foreign key confict not a rly hard fix
    14) pfp across wensite on comments ect.. just better support 
    15)length of username causing problems
    16) figure out rls in soupabase
    17) Make fild gym make the map travel to the province the user is filtering
        1)  I think we should get rid of the search bar in find gym. I have literaly never used it. I think province filter plus the map zooming in on the province is better

    
Things that need fixing

1. The filter / gym side bar is not loading some of the gyms reviews. They are in the DB but not loading on the frontend right sometimes
