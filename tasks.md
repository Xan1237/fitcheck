# To Do

    1)  improve gym filter - price range filter (this might not be doable since we wont know up to date this figure) - by location too
    2)  when searching a location have suggestions pop up while you search
    3)  Make the "log in to leave a review" better
    4)  figure out why the hell the gym map is not visible for mobile on desctop bit is visible on my actual phone 
    5)  add the form auth codes to .env (I think we should do this) (what does this even mean)
    6)  the log in token keep expiring and it kills the database
    7) split controllers into multiple files for better code clairity
    8) Create a system for recomending diffrent post/ pageanation for the results
    9) post likes
    11) improve some mobile view stuff
    12) for create profile, Gender should be a checkable box not a typing input box
   

    
Things that need fixing

1. On mobile view users can't log in
2. On mobile the contact tab breaks the UI(the bottom nav bar breaks and there is a white bar)

IDEAS

    1)  the home page should be diffrent and what the home page is not should be like a search page
